Description: We develop MUlti-source Graph Synthesis (MUGS), an algorithm designed to create 
    embeddings for pediatric EHR codes by leveraging graphical information from three distinct sourcesï¼š
    (1) pediatric EHR data, (2) EHR data from the general patient population, and 
    (3) existing hierarchical medical ontology knowledge shared across different patient populations.
