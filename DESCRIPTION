Description: We develop MUlti-source Graph Synthesis (MUGS), an algorithm designed to create 
    embeddings for pediatric EHR codes by leveraging graphical information from three distinct sources：
    (1) pediatric EHR data, (2) EHR data from the general patient population, and 
    (3) existing hierarchical medical ontology knowledge shared across different patient populations.
